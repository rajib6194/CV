My dream is not not to run after  money, from my childhood. 
I wanted fame and name.... I wished a simple but happy life. I personally 
like SHARAT CHANDRA, ROBINDRONATH THAGOR, DELL KARNEGI. <br>
form them I take motivation. They help me to walk through my dreams. <br>
I love to read novels, poem, drama, science fiction.
